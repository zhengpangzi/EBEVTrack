## Abstract
Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision that requires accurately detecting and continuously tracking multiple targets across video frames. However, existing methods struggle with objects that have similar appearances or are occluded. Birdâ€™s-Eye View (BEV) can reduce perspective distortion and provide spatial consistency, but traditional implementations usually rely on complex 3D perception or multi-camera systems. To address these limitations, we propose EBEVTrack, a novel online tracker that estimates BEV from monocular 2D images. Specifically, we design two key strategies: BEV-based Data Association (BDA), which links targets using their spatial relationships in the BEV coordinate system, and Occluded Target Search (OTS), which reduces false trajectories and identity switches by handling occluded targets. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 demonstrate that EBEVTrack achieves superior robustness and accuracy. The source code and data are available at: https://github.com/zhengpangzi/EBEVTrack.
